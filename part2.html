      <p>Factors that influence choices of programming languages. </p>
      <h4>Organisational Policy</h4>
      <p>Certain organisational policies prevent ‘normal’ employees to install software, only the IT administrators can. This helps against installing malware into the computer network. Due to these constraints, only employees can only use certain programming languages. Languages like JavaScript can be written in a text editor like Notepad and then executed in a browser such as Google Chrome.</p>
      </br>
      <p><b>JavaScript </b></p>
      <p> JavaScript can be written in a text editor like Notepad and then executed in a browser such as Google Chrome, which means no specific programs have to be installed like IDE’s, although a text editor and browser needs to be installed. </p>
      </br>
      <h4>Reliability </h4>
      <p>Many programming languages have functionality to the programs created to be more reliable. This can be achieved though using techniques in other programming languages or paradigms.</p>
  	 </br>
      <p><b>Python </b></p>
      <p>By using different libraries, programmers can expand their programs. Different libraries can implement different features. Such as Time implements Time functions and Random implements Random functions. </p> 
      </br>
  	  <h4>Developement and Maintainance Costs</h4>
  	  <p>The business should think about the costs of development and maintaining the program. Also, the costs of software licences, such as Visual Studio for Visual Programming and the Adobe Suite for doing many things such as web development (Dreamweaver) and graphic design (Illustrator).</p>
</br>
        <p><b>Visual Basic .NET </b></p>
        <p>Intended to be easy to learn and use. It enables RAD (Rapid Application Development) of GUI’s (Graphical User Interface).</p>
        <p>To make applications with Visual Basic .NET, you need to install Visual Studio by Microsoft. The community version is free, if it’s being used in an education environment, academic research or for contributing to open source projects. </p>
        <p>If the organisation has over 250 PC’s or $1 million USD in annual revenue then they have to get the Professional or Enterprise version of Visual Studio. Enterprise subscription costs £6,893.00 inc VAT and Professional costs £573.00 inc VAT.</p>
  	</br>
  	<h4>Expandability</h4>
  	<p>The business should think about the expandability of the program, and therefore the programming language. Easily expandable programs make sure that they can have more uses at once. Also, expandable programming languages accounts for larger/more complex features.</p>
